    "The dataset includes the following variables:\n",
    "<br>1. Date: The date of the observation.\n",
    "<br>2. Recession: A binary variable indicating recession perion; 1 means it was recession, 0 means it was normal.\n",
    "<br>3. Automobile_Sales: The number of vehicles sold during the period.\n",
    "<br>4. GDP: The per capita GDP value in USD.\n",
    "<br>5. Unemployment_Rate: The monthly unemployment rate.\n",
    "<br>6. Consumer_Confidence: A synthetic index representing consumer confidence, which can impact consumer spending and automobile purchases.\n",
    "<br>7. Seasonality_Weight: The weight representing the seasonality effect on automobile sales during the period.\n",
    "<br>8. Price: The average vehicle price during the period.\n",
    "<br>9. Advertising_Expenditure: The advertising expenditure of the company.\n",
    "<br>10.Vehicle_Type: The type of vehicles sold; Supperminicar, Smallfamiliycar,                 Mediumfamilycar, Executivecar, Sports.\n",
    "<br>11.Competition: The measure of competition in the market, such as the number of competitors or market share of major manufacturers.\n",
    "<br>12.Month: Month of the observation extracted from Date..\n",
    "<br>13.Year: Year of the observation extracted from Date.\n",
